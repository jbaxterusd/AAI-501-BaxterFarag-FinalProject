github: https://github.com/jbaxterusd/AAI-501-BaxterFarag-FinalProject

This project is part of the AAI-501 Course in the Applied Artificial Intelligence Program at the University of San Diego (USD)
--Project Status: [Completed]

Dataset: https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/cbis-ddsm/
Curated Breast Imaging Subset of Digital Database for Screening Mammography (CBIS-DDSM)

Intro/Objective: 
The purpose of our project was to create a hybrid AI model to predict breast cancer diagnosis. Specifically, we aim to utilize image based classification using Convolutional Neural Networks and further analyze/predict the feature data with a Random Forest classifier. 

The scope of our project focuses on predicting the diagnosis of tumors (benign/malignant) based on significant mass segmentation of the tumor.
